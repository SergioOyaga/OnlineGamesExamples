## In This Folder
This folder contains 5 online game solved using the OptimizationLib:

1. [LinkedInQueens](https://github.com/SergioOyaga/OnlineGamesExamples/tree/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/LinkedInQueens):
   This problem involves placing N queens on an NxN chessboard such that each row, column and color only contains one Queen, and two queens cannot touch each other, not even diagonally.

2. [LinkedInTango](https://github.com/SergioOyaga/OnlineGamesExamples/tree/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/LinkedInTango):
   This problem consists of filling an NxN grid so that each cell contains either a :sunny: or a :first_quarter_moon_with_face:. No more than 2 :sunny: or :first_quarter_moon_with_face: may be next to each other either vertically or horizontally. Each row and column must contain the same number of :sunny: and :first_quarter_moon_with_face:. There are some constraints between cells. Cells separated with = must be the same type, and cells separated by X must be the opposite type.

3. [LinkedInZip](https://github.com/SergioOyaga/OnlineGamesExamples/tree/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/LinkedInZip):
   This problem consists of connecting X numbered cells of an NxM grid following the number order, and filling every cell with the path followed. Some barriers separate some cells.

4. [LinkedInSudoku](https://github.com/SergioOyaga/OnlineGamesExamples/tree/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/LinkedInSudoku):
This problem involves placing numbers 1&rarr;M in a MxM grid, in such a way  that all numbers are present in each row, each column and each of the M NxM/N predefined blocks.

5. [Sudoku](https://github.com/SergioOyaga/OnlineGamesExamples/tree/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/Sudoku):
   This problem involves placing numbers 1&rarr;9 in a 9x9 grid, in such a way  that all numbers are present in each row, each column and each of the 9 3x3 predefined blocks. 

## Comment:
The examples in this repository illustrate the power and versatility of the OptimizationLib framework. Remember, these examples serve as templates that you can adapt for your specific optimization problems.
